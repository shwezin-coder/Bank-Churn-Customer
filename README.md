IntroductionThis project addresses the critical business challenge of customer attrition within a banking institution. Customer churn significantly impacts profitability and customer lifetime value. The traditional reactive approach to churn management is inefficient; hence, there was a clear need for a proactive, predictive system.2. Project GoalThe primary objective was to leverage comprehensive data analysis, statistical validation, and machine learning to accurately predict customer churn, identify the underlying factors driving attrition, and develop actionable, data-driven strategies to improve customer retention and engagement.3. Technologies UsedProgramming Language: PythonKey Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, SciPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, PlotlyInteractive Applications: StreamlitData Source: Excel4. Approach & Key ContributionsMy approach followed a comprehensive data science pipeline, from meticulous data acquisition and rigorous cleaning to advanced modeling, insight generation, and interactive deployment:1. Data Acquisition & Initial AssessmentInitiated by extracting raw customer data from multiple Excel sheets (e.g., Bank_Churn_Messy.xlsx, Bank_Churn_Data_D....xlsx).Performed initial assessments to understand data schemas, variable types, and potential inconsistencies across sheets.2. Comprehensive Data Cleaning & PreprocessingData Merging: Merged customer info and account info sheets based on common identifiers, ensuring data integrity across datasets.Data Type Validation: Systematically checked and matched data types across merged columns, rectifying discrepancies.Duplicate Handling: Identified and removed duplicate rows and duplicate columns to ensure data uniqueness and reduce redundancy.Column Renaming & Standardization: Renamed columns for clarity and standardized categorical columns (e.g., Gender, Geography) to consistent formats.Missing Value Handling: Identified missing values using df.isnull().sum(). For numerical features, missing values were imputed with the median to preserve distribution shape. For categorical features, missing values were imputed with the mode or a designated 'Unknown' category.Outlier Detection & Treatment: Employed the IQR (Interquartile Range) method and visualized distributions (e.g., box plots using Seaborn) to detect outliers in numerical features. Outliers were then capped at the 99th percentile or floored at the 1st percentile to mitigate their impact on model performance while preserving data.Feature Engineering: Created new, insightful features (e.g., AvgSavingsToIncome ratio, HasCreditCard flag) to enrich the dataset and enhance predictive power.3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & VisualizationAfter cleaning, I performed in-depth EDA and explored summary statistics on the merged dataset.Key observations from EDA included:A 100% correlation between credit card ownership and active status, indicating a strong link between these two variables.Segment-specific patterns were identified for age, income, geography, and gender.Visualization of savings across geographies showed that customers in Germany are predominantly saving customers, while Spain and France hold significant untapped potential for savings products. France alone constituted 50% of the customer base.Correlation analysis between numerical columns revealed strong correlation only between CreditCard and IsActiveMember; other numerical variables showed weak or no strong correlations with each other.Visualizations were created using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to effectively communicate these patterns and insights.4. Statistical Analysis & Hypothesis Testing for Churn DriversInitial visual analysis of churn status (e.g., between credit score groups) revealed significant differences, prompting formal statistical validation.Applied rigorous hypothesis testing to statistically confirm relationships between variables and churn:T-test: Conducted between CreditScore for churners vs. non-churners to assess mean differences.Mann-Whitney U test: Applied to EstimatedSalary for churners vs. non-churners, given its non-normal distribution.Chi-squared (Chi²) test: Used to assess the relationship between categorical variables and churn status.Key Findings from Statistical Tests on Churn Drivers:NumOfProducts, Age Group, Geography, Active Status, Saving Group, and Credit Score Group were highly related to churn or stay status.NumOfProducts and Age Group showed a particularly strong relationship with churn.Geography, Active Status, and Saving Group also exhibited strong correlations.Credit Score Group was correlated but less strongly than the variables above.Importantly, Tenure and EstimatedSalary were found not to be significantly related to churn.This rigorous statistical analysis provided a deep, data-backed understanding of "why" customers churned, informing feature selection for predictive models.5. Feature Engineering for Predictive ModelingBefore model training, significant feature engineering was performed:All categorical variables were transformed using One-Hot Encoding.Numerical features (Balance, CreditScore, EstimatedSalary) were converted into group/bin-based categorical data (e.g., CreditScoreGroup, IncomeGroup) and then one-hot encoded. This was crucial as initial EDA indicated non-linear relationships with churn, making group-based features more effective than raw numerical inputs.6. Predictive Modeling & Detailed Churn InsightsModel Training: Trained predictive models using Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation to ensure robust evaluation across different churn proportions and RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning, ensuring optimal model performance across the entire dataset.Model Selection: Logistic Regression was chosen as the primary model due to its superior interpretability and its performance being comparable to (or not significantly different from) Random Forest for this dataset.Performance: The Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy of 0.83 and an F1-score of 0.60. While it successfully predicted 62% of churners, it also indicated that 38% of churners were still being missed, highlighting a clear area for potential future model improvements (e.g., exploring advanced techniques or new data sources).Exported Insights: Cleaned data (cleaned_data.csv), feature coefficients (feature_coefficient.csv), and churn probabilities were exported to CSV for further analysis and easy access by business teams.7. Strategic Customer Segmentation & Actionable RecommendationsBased on predictive probabilities, we extracted potential high-risk customers (above 70% churn probability) for proactive intervention.Developed actionable insights and segmented customers for targeted interventions:High-Value Churned (3.14%): Identified for immediate recovery efforts.High-Engagement Segment (3.4%): Profiled as active customers with credit score >700, salary & balance >€100k (mostly male, age 24–60). Ideal targets for new product launches and promotions.High-Potential Segment (2.43%): Defined as inactive but retained customers with strong credit (>700), ~€100k salary & savings. Recommended for targeted credit card offers due to the 100% link observed between credit cards and activity.High-Value Segment (4.8%): Comprising both active and inactive customers with credit score >700, salary >€100k. Inactive sub-segment targeted with credit card plans, while active sub-segment could be offered strict loans or adjusted savings rates to enhance retention.Formulated concrete, data-backed recommendations:Boost engagement with targeted credit card offerings, specifically for customers without cards, as they are often inactive and more likely to churn.Focus marketing and product development on the critical 33–44 age group.Run savings campaigns in Spain & France, and conduct a competitor/service review in Germany to address regional churn.Implement cross-selling strategies tailored by gender and region (e.g., more to females, encourage males to add products).Prioritize early intervention on customers with >70% churn risk by all relevant teams (Ops & Service).8. Interactive Application Development & Deployment (Streamlit)To ensure insights were accessible and actionable for business stakeholders, I designed the user interface through collaborative sketching sessions on Zoom Whiteboard. This process was crucial for defining user flows, key visualizations, and dashboard layout.Subsequently, I developed and deployed an interactive Streamlit application (dashboard.py). This powerful tool allows stakeholders to:Visualize overall churn metrics and segment performance dynamically.Explore influencing factors through interactive charts.Input customer data for real-time churn risk prediction.Access detailed customer tables (e.g., "High-Value Table," "Potential Customers Table"), empowering Marketing, Sales, Key Account, Operations, and Service teams for precise, targeted actions.Ethical Considerations & Future Steps:Maintained strict PII compliance and emphasized responsible data use at all stages of the project lifecycle.Outlined clear next steps for the bank, including continuous monitoring of churn metrics, refinement of the predictive model (especially focusing on improving recall for missed churners), and tracking the effectiveness of segment-specific campaign effectiveness.5. Impact & OutcomeThis project provided the banking institution with a robust analytical framework and a user-friendly, interactive tool to proactively identify and engage at-risk customers. By translating complex data into actionable, statistically validated insights, it enabled the bank to optimize marketing and product development efforts, leading to more informed decisions that significantly improve customer retention, engagement, and overall profitability.6.
